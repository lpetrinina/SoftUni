                            Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions. Small minds will always do
                            that, but great minds will give you a feeling that you can become great too.

                            Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you made
                            the effort to become the best of which you are capable.

                        <p>Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The ability to direct
                            individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows
                            common people to attain uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is
                            what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a civilisation work.
